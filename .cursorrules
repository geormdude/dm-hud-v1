// DM HUD Project Configuration
Project Type: Interactive DM screen for tabletop RPGs
Core Stack: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, Local Storage

Coding Standards:
- Module pattern for component organization
- Event-driven architecture
- State management through centralized store
- Descriptive naming for readability
- JSDoc comments for complex logic

Architecture Patterns:
- Component-based UI
- Pub/Sub event system
- Immutable state updates
- Local storage persistence

Component Structure:
- Each component should follow init/cacheDOM/bindEvents/render pattern
- Components should not directly modify DOM outside their container
- Data flow through state manager only
- Clear separation between data and presentation

Security Requirements:
- No external dependencies or API calls
- Input validation for all user-provided data
- Safe local storage handling

Testing Strategy:
- Manual testing of UI interactions
- Console logging for state transitions
- Local storage persistence verification

Design Principles:
- Focus on cognitive optimization 
- Minimize context switching
- Prioritize glanceability of information
- Color coding for fast identification
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
